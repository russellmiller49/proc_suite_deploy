{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Indication: [post‑operative/post‑procedural/spontaneous] persistent air leak. Localization by sequential balloon occlusion identified [lobe/segment] as the source. A [Zephyr/Spiration] one‑way valve [size] was deployed in [segment]. Immediate reduction in air leak on digital drainage device was [complete/partial/none]. Additional valves placed: [number/segments]. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Post‑procedure plan: [suction settings, CXR timing, ambulation].
