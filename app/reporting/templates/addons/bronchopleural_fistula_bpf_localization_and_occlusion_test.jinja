{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
With an existing [chest tube/IPC] connected to a water seal/digital drainage device, sequential balloon occlusion of [segmental/lobar] bronchi was performed using a [Fogarty/Elation] balloon while monitoring for cessation of bubbling/flow. Leak reduction with occlusion of [segment] was [complete/partial/none]. Confirmation with instillation of [methylene blue/dilute contrast] through the chest tube showed [appearance/lack] of dye at the occluded airway. Based on localization, [valve placement/sealant application] was [performed/deferred]. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
