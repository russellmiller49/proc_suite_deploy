With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was infiltrated. A vertical skin incision was made just inferior to the cricoid. A needle was inserted into the trachea under direct bronchoscopic visualization and a guidewire advanced between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings. After sequential dilation, the tracheostomy tube was placed over a guiding catheter into the trachea, the obturator removed, and ventilation transferred to the tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
