INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
Patient: Elaine Young  MRN: SYNIP0004  Age/Sex: 61/F
Date: 2025-03-05
Indication: Malignant obstruction of left mainstem and left lower lobe bronchus with dyspnea at rest.
Procedure: Rigid and flexible bronchoscopy with mechanical dilation and placement of stents in left mainstem and left lower lobe bronchus.
Anesthesia: General anesthesia with ETT, anesthesia by separate service.
Findings: About 85% narrowing of the left mainstem and 80% narrowing at the origin of the left lower lobe bronchus from tumor and extrinsic compression; copious secretions.
Intervention: Mechanical debulking with the rigid barrel and suction restored a small lumen. Balloon dilation to 12 mm in the left mainstem followed by deployment of a 12 x 40 mm metallic stent. A second 10 x 30 mm metallic stent was placed in the left lower lobe bronchus as an extension. Final appearance showed <20% residual narrowing and markedly improved ventilation.
Complications: Brief bleeding <30 mL, controlled with iced saline; no hypoxia.
Disposition: Extubated in OR and discharged to surgical ICU in stable condition.

bronchoscopy note - <DATE_TIME>

pt Kathleen Rogers mrn 8900444 is a 85yo male here for bronch w EBUS staging and robotic biopsy of a 14.0mm LUL nodule that was ground-glass on CT, bronchus sign was negative, PET showed SUV 17.6.

under general we did linear EBUS first using the Pentax EB-1990i scope with 22g needle and sampled stations 2L x3, 4L x2, 10R x2, 10L x3, 11L x2, ROSE was there and showed Atypical cells at multiple stations.

then switched to Ion robot and navigated to the LUL apicoposterior (B1+2) lesion, registration was 1.5mm which is fine, got radial EBUS showing concentric view and did tool in lesion confirmation with fluoroscopy. took 7 forceps bx, 2 needle passes, brushings x2, BAL sent for cultures.

ROSE from the nodule was Adequate lymphocytes, no malignancy.

no bleeding no ptx   patient did well

specimens to path for cyto, surgical path, cell block, flow, molecular if needed

d/c home after recovery with standard precautions, f/u 1-2wks for path

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROCEDURE: Left medical thoracoscopy. Under general anesthesia and single-lung ventilation, the left pleural space was accessed. 1400 mL of straw-colored exudate were evacuated. Visualization revealed diffuse nodularity of the parietal pleura. Multiple biopsies were obtained using forceps. A 24 Fr chest tube was inserted via the access site. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

After obtaining informed consent, the patient was brought to the bronchoscopy suite and placed under moderate sedation. A flexible bronchoscope was introduced through the mouth. We inspected the airway and found no endobronchial abnormalities. We then targeted the subcarinal lymph node (Station 7) for staging using a conventional 21-gauge Wang needle. Four needle passes were performed based on anatomic landmarks. The on-site pathologist confirmed the presence of malignant cells. The procedure was completed without any significant complications.
