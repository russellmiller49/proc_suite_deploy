A CBCT/CACT spin was obtained intra‑procedurally. NaviLink 3D image fusion was performed to align intra‑op imaging with the pre‑procedure CT. Registration correction applied: [translation mm] / [rotation degrees] to the catheter path. The updated overlay demonstrated [on‑target/adjacent] trajectory; navigation plan was updated accordingly. A confirmatory spin verified corrected alignment. The patient tolerated the imaging without complications.
