{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Ultrasound confirmed a [side] effusion. The thoracentesis was performed as per sterile protocol. Pleural pressure was measured with a digital/manometer system at baseline and after each [250/500] mL removed. Opening pressure: [cmH₂O]. Pressures at volumes: [table]. Stopping criteria: [elastance rise/pressure ≤ –20 cmH₂O/symptoms]. Total removed: [mL]. The patient tolerated the procedure without cough, chest pain, or hypotension. Post‑procedure ultrasound/CXR: [ordered/not indicated].
