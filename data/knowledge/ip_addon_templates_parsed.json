A time out was performed prior to procedure.\nSedation with [type]. Vitals monitored throughout procedure.\nFINDINGS:\n5 cc of 2% lidocaine was instilled into the endotracheal tube for topical anesthesia.\nThe bronchoscope was then passed via the ETT into the trachea.\nThe bronchoscope was first passed into the right mainstem bronchus and each segment was systematically identified and inspected. The RUL, RML and RLL were all patent. Mucosal normal without endobronchial lesions. No significant secretions.\nNext, attention was turned to the left sided airways. The bronchoscope was advanced into the left main bronchus and each segment was systematically identified and inspected. The LUL, lingular and LLL were all patent. Mucosa normal without endobronchial lesions. No significant secretions.\nBAL of the [segment] was performed. Instilled [cc] sterile saline with return of [cc].\nSummary:\n\nPharynx: Not assessed due to Bronch introduction via ETT/Trach Tube\nLarynx: Not assessed due to Bronch introduction via ETT/Trach Tube\nVocal Cords: Not assessed due to Bronch introduction via ETT/Trach Tube\nTrachea: Distal 1/3 Normal\nRight Lung: [findings]\nLeft Lung: [findings]\nNo evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other intra-bronchial pathology.\nMucosa: [findings]\nSecretions: [findings].
