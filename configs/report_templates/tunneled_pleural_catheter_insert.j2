Chest Ultrasound Findings

{% if proc.side %}Hemithorax: {{ proc.side | title }}{% endif %}

Findings: Pleural effusion identified and site marked for procedure.

Catheter Placement{% if proc.side %} The {{ proc.side | lower }} chest{% else %} The chest{% endif %} was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was infiltrated at the insertion site. A finder needle was used to enter the pleural space; pleural fluid was aspirated to confirm location. The needle was withdrawn and a guidewire was placed into the pleural space.

Two 5 mm skin incisions were made at the guidewire entry site, as well as 5-6 cm away. The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue. Serial dilation over the guidewire was then achieved. The introducer sheath was placed and the guidewire removed.

{% if proc.drainage_device %}The {{ proc.drainage_device }}{% else %}The tunneled pleural catheter{% endif %} was then placed into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with an absorbable suture. The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied.
