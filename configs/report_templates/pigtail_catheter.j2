Pigtail Catheter Placement (Modified for Drainage) The insertion site was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Anesthesia: Lidocaine 1% was used for local anesthesia.{% if proc.side %} Entry Site: {{ proc.side | title }} hemithorax.{% endif %}

Findings and Technique: A {{ proc.size_fr }} pigtail catheter was utilized. A pigtail catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique. Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trocar) was advanced over the guidewire.
