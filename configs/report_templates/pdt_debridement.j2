Airway Inspection and Debridement A rigid bronchoscope was introduced under direct visualization. A complete airway survey was performed. Attention was directed to the {{ _site }}, which showed significant necrosis consistent with the recent Photodynamic Therapy.

Debridement A follow-up bronchoscopy was performed to address the {{ _site }} necrosis. The necrotic tissue at the {{ _site }} was debrided{% if _tools %} using{% if "forceps" in _tools %} mechanical forceps{% endif %}{% if "rigid" in _tools and "cor" in _tools %}{% if "forceps" in _tools %},{% endif %} rigid coring{% endif %}{% if "cryo" in _tools %}{% if "forceps" in _tools or ("rigid" in _tools and "cor" in _tools) %},{% endif %} and a cryoprobe{% endif %}{% endif %}.{% if "cryo" in _tools %} The cryoprobe was applied to adherent secretions and necrotic tissue until adherence was achieved, and the probe was withdrawn.{% endif %}
