Airway Inspection The bronchoscope was introduced and a systematic airway inspection was performed, noting normal anatomy without endobronchial lesions.

Radial EBUS & Preparation Attention was turned to {{ _target_lobe }}.

rEBUS Survey: A radial EBUS probe was advanced to the basilar segments. The survey confirmed the absence of significant vessels at the selected biopsy sites and allowed for navigation to the periphery.

{% if proc.blocker_type %}Balloon Block: A {{ proc.blocker_type }} was positioned prophylactically at the lobar/segmental orifice to provide immediate tamponade if necessary.{% endif %}

Transbronchial Cryobiopsy A{% if proc.cryoprobe_size_mm %} {{ proc.cryoprobe_size_mm | fmt_unit("mm") }}{% endif %} cryoprobe was utilized for sampling.

{% if proc.freeze_seconds and _segments %}
{% for seg in _segments %}
Site {{ loop.index }} ({{ seg | trim }}): The probe was advanced to the target. A {{ proc.freeze_seconds }}-second freeze cycle was applied. The probe and scope were withdrawn en bloc.
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Findings & Hemostasis

{% if proc.num_samples %}Yield: A total of {{ proc.num_samples }} samples were collected{% if proc.sample_size_mm is not none %}, measuring approximately {{ proc.sample_size_mm | fmt_unit("mm") }} each{% endif %}.{% endif %}

Hemostasis: {% if proc.blocker_type %}The prophylactic {{ proc.blocker_type }} was utilized/monitored. {% endif %}Final airway inspection demonstrated no clinically significant bleeding.

Pneumothorax Check: Post-procedure assessment demonstrated no pneumothorax.
