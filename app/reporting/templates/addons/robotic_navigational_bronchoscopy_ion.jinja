Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the Intuitive Ion system. A navigation plan from the pre-procedure CT was loaded and registration completed. The Ion catheter was advanced under navigational guidance. Radial EBUS confirmed appropriate position. Cone-beam CT was performed for trajectory verification. Sampling was obtained through the extended working channel as detailed. Hemostasis was confirmed. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
