Balloon occlusion was performed to confirm lobe selection. The Chartis system was used to assess for collateral ventilation. Based on criteria, lobes were selected for endobronchial one-way valve therapy. Valves were deployed. Airflow occlusion and target-lobe atelectasis were confirmed endoscopically and physiologically. No immediate complications were observed.
