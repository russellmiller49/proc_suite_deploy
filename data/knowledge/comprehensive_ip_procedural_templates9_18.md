Template: With bronchoscopic visualization, the anterior neck was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was infiltrated. A vertical skin incision was made just inferior to the cricoid. A needle was inserted into the trachea under direct bronchoscopic visualization and a guidewire advanced between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings. After sequential dilation, the tracheostomy tube was placed over a guiding catheter into the trachea, the obturator removed, and ventilation transferred to the tube. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.
The bronchoscope was retracted into the ETT tube and the ET tube retracted into the subglottic space under direct visualization. The inferior border of the cricoid along with the proximal tracheal rings were visualized. Lidocaine 1% 3ml was injected into the anterior neck. A 1 cm incision was made vertically with a #10 blade down through the subcutaneous tissue, just inferior to the cricoid cartilage. A syringe with 1% Lidocaine was then attached to the introducer needle and passed between the 1st and 2nd tracheal rings and into the trachea under direct visualization. This needle was removed and the 18 gauge introducer catheter over needle was then advanced into this position under direct visualization.

The blue Rhino dilator was then removed leaving the guiding catheter and guide wire assembly in place, all under direct visualization bronchoscopically.
Finally a [Trach Type] tracheostomy tube with appropriate dilator was introduced over the guiding catheter into the trachea under direct visualization. The dilator, guiding catheter, and J-wire were then removed and the tracheostomy tube left in place. This was confirmed to be in good position bronchoscopically. The ET tube was then removed and the ventilator connected to the tracheostomy tube. Surgicel was placed preemptively around the tracheostomy site to reduce bleeding.

9. OTHER INTERVENTIONS

Whole Lung Lavage (CPT 32997)
Template: Performed under general anesthesia with double lumen tube. Warm saline instilled and drained until effluent clear.
The patient was induced and intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube (37Fr, left bronchial tube) without difficulty by anesthesia staff. Next, the flexible bronchoscope was advanced into the tracheal portion of the tube to confirm adequate positioning. Tube was re-adjusted to ensure that the tracheal orifice aligned with the right mainstem bronchus. The bronchial lumen could be seen passing into the left mainstem bronchus; positioning was also confirmed with direct bronchoscopic visualization through the bronchial lumen. Next, the bronchial balloon was inflated and tested for leak. Once an adequate seal had been made, the patient was positioned in the [position] lateral decubitus position and the position of the ETT was confirmed with bronchoscopy once again. A repeat leak test was performed and adequate seal was noted.
The patient was now transitioned to single lung ventilation via the [side] lung and the [side] lumen of the ETT was connected to a 3L bag of warmed 0.9% saline. Serial aliquots of saline were instilled at roughly 1 liter increments. After each liter was instilled, it was allowed to dwell for approximately 3-5 minutes before draining by gravity. This process was repeated until the effluent became clear or a maximum volume of 20 liters was reached.

EUS-B (CPT 43237)
Template: Linear EBUS scope advanced into esophagus. Mediastinal nodes visualized and sampled.

Paracentesis (CPT 49083)
Template: Ultrasound guided paracentesis performed. Ascitic fluid aspirated and sent for analysis.

PEG Placement
Template: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy performed with pull-through technique. Tube secured and bumper depth documented.
Under sterile prep and draping, the abdomen was evaluated and 2 cm below the costal margin on the left, the likely point of insertion was identified.
The scope was introduced through the mouth without difficulty and with continuous insufflation, the stomach was reached within [seconds] seconds. Then, the point of digital pressure was identified in the stomach and transillumination was accomplished successfully and without any doubts.
At this point, a 1cm incision was carried out in the skin and a 14ga angiocath was introduced. Using modified Seldinger technique, the angiocath was advanced and a wire was introduced. Using pull through technique, the guide wire was pulled through the mouth and linked to the 20Fr PEG catheter in usual fashion. Thereafter, the wire was pulled through the abdominal wall and the PEG tube positioned correctly with the bumper at [cm] cm. The remaining air was suctioned out and complete apposition of the stomach and esophagus was seen. There were no complications.
The total procedural time was [minutes] min.

PEG can be used for medications 6 hrs post procedure
PEG (or NG tube) can be used for feeds 6 hrs post procedure, as long as tolerating initial free water flushing. No enteral feeding prior.
OK to restart systemic anticoagulation [time], if needed.

Confirmation with instillation of [methylene blue/dilute contrast] through the chest tube showed [appearance/lack] of dye at the occluded airway. Based on localization, [valve placement/sealant application] was [performed/deferred]. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
