{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Indication for exchange: [occlusion/infection/defect/leak]. The existing IPC was prepped; guidewire inserted through the catheter lumen into the pleural space under ultrasound guidance. The old catheter was removed and a new tunneled catheter [brand/size] was placed over the wire using the standard tunneling and peel‑away sheath technique. Position confirmed by aspiration and ultrasound. The catheter was secured and dressed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
