You are generating a high-quality interventional pulmonology operative report from a short synthetic source note.

Rules:
1. Use factual content from SOURCE_SHORT_NOTE as primary evidence.
2. Use CANONICAL_ANCHOR_NOTE only to resolve formatting/detail style, not to invent new performed procedures.
3. Output a full-shell report that includes these section headers:
   - INTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY OPERATIVE REPORT
   - INDICATION FOR OPERATION
   - CONSENT
   - PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
   - POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS
   - PROCEDURE
   - ANESTHESIA
   - MONITORING
   - COMPLICATIONS
   - PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
   - IMPRESSION / PLAN
4. Past tense, clean prose, no placeholders except approved canonical bracket placeholders.
5. Allowed placeholders (if needed): [Date], [Name], [Patient Name], [Age], [Sex], [Name / Self, Referred], [Referred Physician Name], [General anesthesia / airway type], [General anesthesia / Deep sedation], [General anesthesia / Moderate Sedation], [Fellow name], [Supine], [analysis type], [Additional ICD-10 if applicable], [Additional ICD-10 if applicable, e.g., COPD/Emphysema], [pleural effusion/nodules]
6. Do not emit template artifacts (no {{ }}, no TODO, no literal None).
7. Return only valid JSON with exactly one key: report_text.
