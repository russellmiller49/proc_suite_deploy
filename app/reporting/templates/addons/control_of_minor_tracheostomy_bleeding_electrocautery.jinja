{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Minor bleeding was noted from the tracheostomy incision site. Hemostasis did not occur after holding pressure; electrocautery (cautery loop tip) was applied to the bleeding area with FiO₂ confirmed at 40%. Bleeding ceased after Bovie application. The patient tolerated the intervention well without immediate complications.
