Entry into the pleural space was confirmed with the easy removal of pleural fluid. A guidewire was inserted using the introducer needle. The introducer needle was then removed. A dilator was then inserted over the wire with a twisting motion in order to form a tract for catheter insertion. The dilator was removed and the pigtail catheter (with trocar) was advanced over the guidewire. 


Imaging: No imaging was utilized for this procedure (anatomic landmarks only).

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL
After the successful induction of general anesthesia, a timeout was performed confirming the patient's name, procedure type, and procedure location. An 8.0mm endotracheal tube was utilized.

Robotic Navigational Bronchoscopy (Monarch) Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the Monarch platform (Auris Health, J&J). A navigation plan from the pre-procedure CT was loaded. Registration to the body was completed with an error of 1.5mm. The robotic catheter and sheath were advanced to the target in the RUL anterior segment (B3) under navigational guidance.

Sampling: Sampling through the working channel was performed as follows:

Transbronchial Forceps Biopsy: 6 biopsies were obtained.

TBNA: 3 passes were performed.

Brushings: 2 samples were collected.

PROCEDURE IN DETAIL Chest Ultrasound Findings


Hemithorax: Right 


Findings: Pleural effusion identified and site marked for procedure.

Catheter Placement The right chest was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was infiltrated at the insertion site. A finder needle was used to enter the pleural space; pleural fluid was aspirated to confirm location. The needle was withdrawn and a guidewire was placed into the pleural space.

Two 5 mm skin incisions were made at the guidewire entry site, as well as 5-6 cm away. The tunneling device was used to tunnel the catheter in the subcutaneous tissue. Serial dilation over the guidewire was then achieved. The introducer sheath was placed and the guidewire removed.

The 15.5Fr PleurX catheter was then placed into the pleural space via the introducer sheath. The pleural entry site was closed with an absorbable suture. The catheter was secured to the skin using 2-0 nylon. Sterile dressings were applied.
