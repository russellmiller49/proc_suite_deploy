{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Robotic navigation bronchoscopy was performed using the Monarch platform. Pre‑procedure CT‑based plan was loaded and airway registration completed. The robotic catheter and sheath were advanced to the target under navigational guidance. Radial EBUS verified [concentric/eccentric] position. Sampling through the working channel was performed as detailed (brush/forceps/needle/cryobiopsy). If available, CBCT/augmented fluoroscopy was used for trajectory confirmation. Hemostasis was confirmed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
