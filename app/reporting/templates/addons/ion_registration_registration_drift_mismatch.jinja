  Title: Ion Registration — Registration Drift / Mismatch

{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
During navigation, registration drift/mismatch was noted due to [airway deformation/atelectasis/secretions/ETT position/ventilation changes]. Findings: landmark mismatch at [sites] with mean fiducial error [mm]. Mitigation: [airway toilet/PEEP adjustment/re‑inflate lung/re‑registration with additional secondary landmarks/segmental re‑registration/local plan recalibration]. Post‑correction alignment: [improved/adequate/suboptimal]. Proceeded using [shorter trajectory/alternate airway/adjunct imaging] as described.
