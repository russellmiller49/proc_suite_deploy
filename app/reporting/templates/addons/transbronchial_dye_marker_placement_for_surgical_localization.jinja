Under [EMN/robotic/fluoroscopic] guidance, a [gauge] needle catheter was advanced to [distance] cm from the pleural surface at the target. [Methylene blue/Indocyanine green/India ink] [concentration] was injected in [volume] mL to mark the lesion for surgical wedge resection. Marker diffusion was observed endoscopically/fluoroscopically. No immediate bleeding or air leak was seen. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
