{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
After navigation to the target, a radial EBUS probe with guide sheath [diameter] was advanced to the lesion. Ultrasound pattern: [concentric/eccentric/adjacent], lesion size [mm]. The probe was withdrawn leaving the guide sheath in situ. Sampling was performed via the guide sheath using [forceps/brush/needle] with [number] passes for each tool. Fluoroscopy used: [Yes/No]. ROSE (if available): [result]. Hemostasis was confirmed; no pneumothorax was evident on intra‑procedure assessment. Specimens: [cytology/histology/microbiology]. Post‑procedure CXR: [ordered/not indicated]. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
