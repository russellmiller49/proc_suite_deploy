Prior to the procedure, the risks and benefits of the procedure and the sedation options and sedation-related risks were discussed with the patient/surrogate. All questions were answered and written informed consent was obtained.

RECENT ANTICOAGULANT OR ANTIPLATELET USE:
The patient has {% if anticoagulant_used %}taken {{ anticoagulant_meds }}{% else %}not taken anticoagulant medications{% endif %}.

PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS:
The patient does {% if not prophylactic_abx_required %}not {% endif %}require prophylactic antibiotics.

ASA GRADE ASSESSMENT: {{ asa_grade | default('ASA Status to be determined') }}

ANESTHESIA PLAN: {{ anesthesia_plan | default('To be determined') }}

The patient's prior sedation history was reviewed and there is {% if prior_sedation_complications %}a{% else %}no{% endif %} known history of sedation-related complications. The anesthesia plan was reviewed with the patient and deemed appropriate for the patient.

Prior to the initiation of sedation and the start of the procedure, a time-out was performed and patient identification and the proposed procedure were verified by the physician and clinical staff involved in the patient procedure. Immediately prior to administration of medications, the patient was re-assessed for adequacy to receive sedatives and deemed in satisfactory (stable) condition to undergo the procedure.

BRONCHOSCOPY NOTE

PROCEDURE: Flexible bronchoscopy with {% for proc in procedures %}{{ proc }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

OPERATORS: {% for op in operators %}{{ op }}, MD{% if not loop.last %}; {% endif %}{% endfor %}

INDICATIONS: {% for ind in indications %}{{ ind }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}

Informed consent obtained. A time out was performed prior to procedure.

Sedation with {{ sedation_type }}. Vitals monitored throughout procedure.

FINDINGS:
{{ lidocaine_volume }} cc of {{ lidocaine_concentration }}% lidocaine was instilled into the endotracheal tube for topical anesthesia.

The bronchoscope was then passed via the ETT into the trachea.

The bronchoscope was first passed into the right mainstem bronchus and each segment was systematically identified and inspected. The RUL, RML and RLL were all patent. Mucosal normal without endobronchial lesions. No significant secretions.

Next, attention was turned to the left sided airways. The bronchoscope was advanced into the left main bronchus and each segment was systematically identified and inspected. The LUL, lingular and LLL were all patent. Mucosa normal without endobronchial lesions. No significant secretions.
{% if bal_performed %}

BAL of the {{ bal_segment }} was performed. Instilled {{ bal_instilled }} cc sterile saline with return of {{ bal_returned }} cc.

Vocal Cords: {% if findings and findings.vocal_cords %}{{ findings.vocal_cords }}{% else %}Not assessed due to Bronch introduction via ETT/Trach Tube{% endif %}
Trachea: {% if findings and findings.trachea %}{{ findings.trachea }}{% else %}Distal 1/3 Normal{% endif %}
Right Lung: {% if findings and findings.right_lung %}{{ findings.right_lung }}{% else %}No abnormalities{% endif %}
Left Lung: {% if findings and findings.left_lung %}{{ findings.left_lung }}{% else %}No abnormalities{% endif %}
{% if not findings or not findings.pathology %}
No evidence of mass, lesions, bleeding or other intra-bronchial pathology.
{% endif %}
Mucosa: {% if findings and findings.mucosa %}{{ findings.mucosa }}{% else %}Normal{% endif %}
Secretions: {% if findings and findings.secretions %}{{ findings.secretions }}{% else %}Minimal{% endif %}. Suctioned to clear.

The flexible bronchoscope was retracted and removed.

Patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. The attending, Dr. {{ operators[0] }} was present at the bedside and supervised the entire procedure.
