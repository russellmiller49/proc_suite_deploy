A [left/right] DLT [size/Fr] was placed by anesthesia. Position was confirmed bronchoscopically: tracheal lumen aligned with the [right] mainstem; bronchial cuff seated [just below] the [left/right] main carina. Leak test performed and adequate seal noted. Adjustments: [advanced/withdrawn/rotated] by [cm/degrees]. Final position re‑verified after patient positioning. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
