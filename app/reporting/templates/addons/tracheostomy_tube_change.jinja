{% macro render(ctx=None) -%}
Upper airway was suctioned and cleared. Endotracheal suctioning performed. The cuff was deflated and the existing tracheostomy tube ([old_trach_type] [old_size]) removed. The stoma was widely patent without granulation tissue. A new tracheostomy tube ([new_trach_type] [new_size]) was placed with obturator in place, the obturator was removed, the inner cannula inserted, and the cuff inflated. Position and patency were confirmed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
