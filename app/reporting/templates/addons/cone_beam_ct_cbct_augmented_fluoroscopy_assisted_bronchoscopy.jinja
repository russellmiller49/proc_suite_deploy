Following initial navigation, a CBCT spin was acquired with the patient on [ventilation settings]. Three‑dimensional reconstruction and overlay were used to confirm catheter‑to‑target alignment; trajectory adjusted by [mm/degrees] as indicated. A confirmatory CBCT spin showed [on‑target/adjacent] position. Sampling was then performed as detailed elsewhere. Radiation parameters recorded: [if available]. The patient tolerated the imaging adjunct without immediate complications.
