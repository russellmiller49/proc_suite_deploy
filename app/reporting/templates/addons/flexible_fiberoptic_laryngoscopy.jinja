Flexible laryngoscopy was performed by advancing the scope along the floor of the nose. Nasal cavity, nasopharynx, vallecula, supraglottis, glottis, post-cricoid region, and piriform sinuses were systematically evaluated without suspicious mass or mucosal lesions. Vocal folds adducted and abducted normally and symmetrically. No obvious abnormalities noted along the nasal chamber. Pharyngeal walls, tongue base, vallecula, epiglottis, supraglottis, glottis, post-cricoid, and piriform sinuses were evaluated and found to be without evidence of suspicious mass or mucosal lesions.
