Registration to the pre‑procedure CT was completed using [automatic/manual] methods with adequate airway landmark matching (carina, lobar carinas, tertiary bifurcations). Mean fiducial error: [mm]. Global alignment quality: [excellent/good]. No registration drift observed during the case. A confidence sweep confirmed stable targeting throughout the planned trajectory.
